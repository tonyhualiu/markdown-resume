  Reduced database load from master node during peak season. Anaylized load test log to
  locate the bottle neck quries. Several steps I took: Set up crons to
  precalculate large agregated queries; moved read-only queries that does not
  require read-write consistency to read-only slave node; Summerized possible
  failure scenerio assuming 24 hours delay from slave node for documentation and
  future improvements.

  Built a Design Voting Stream to collect consumer vote and help customer
  acquisition. The project was done in a week to assist a business presentation
  for the CEO. (http://cdn3.minted.com/files/demo/touch_voting.html)
